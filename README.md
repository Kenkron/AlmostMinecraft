Tweaks minecraft to make it more automatable.


The Basic Idea
--------------

Is to add to what minecraft can do without adding new blocks.  So far, these are the accepted changes:

1. Droppers can now plant things.
2. Pistons break blocks when they push a block of iron against a target block against another block of iron.
3. Animals eat food if it is dropped on them.

Possible future additions:
1. A shapeless automatic crafter may be added (most likely involving hoppers leading to a crafting table above a hopper), but it's hard to see how that could work.
2. Beacons may be made to act as chunkloaders.
